okapi (pronounced "oh-copy") is a robust file copying utility for Linux
that gracefully handles the utter grossness of symlinks and
sub-directories.

To invoke, simply run:

  okapi <path> <src_prefix> <dst_prefix>

It will copy $src_prefix/$path into $dst_prefix/$path, creating all
necessary layers of symlinks and sub-directories along the way.
$src_prefix may be "".

ALL three input paths must be absolute paths.
